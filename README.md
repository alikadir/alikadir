![Hey there, I'm Ali. I'm a software developer](https://github.com/alikadir/alikadir/blob/main/js.png)


For 14 years, I have been working in different roles such as Software Developer, Software Architect or Software Team Lead. I took part in many different projects and teams, and I had the opportunity to gain valuable experiences using different technologies.

I have been working with Cloud and JavaScript technologies for the past seven years.
Technologies I enjoy using,

- React
- Redux
- React Native
- Ionic Framework
- NextJS
- GraphQL
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- Redis

and of course,

- AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Amplify Framework)
- Firebase
- Azure DevOps (CI-CD Pipelines)
- Figma (Design & Prototype Tool)

Additionally, I have strong experience (+7 years) in Microsoft technologies like C#, TypeScript, MsSQL, Entity Framework, .Net Core and Asp.Net MVC.

I believe that Serverless Architecture and BaaS (Backend as a Service) structures will dominate the software industry in the future, and I continue to shape my career in this perspective.
