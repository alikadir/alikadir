![Hey there, I'm Ali. I'm a software developer](https://github.com/alikadir/alikadir/blob/main/js.png)

For **15** years, I have been working in different roles such as **Software Developer**, **Software Architect** and **Software Team Leader**. I took part in many different projects and teams, and I had the opportunity to gain valuable experiences using different technologies.

I have been working with Cloud and JavaScript (**Frontend**, **Backend**, **Mobile**) technologies for the past seven years.
I'm hands-on coding currently on,

- React
- Redux / Saga
- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- GraphQL
- React Native
- Ionic Framework

and of course,

- **AWS** (API Gateway, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Amplify, AWS-SAM)
- **Firebase**
- **Azure DevOps** (CI-CD Pipelines)
- **DigitalOcean Cloud** (Linux - Droplets, Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing, Nginx, Firewalls, DNS)
- **Figma** (Design & Prototype Tool)

Additionally, I have strong experience (+7 years) in Microsoft technologies like C#, TypeScript, MsSQL, Entity Framework, .Net Core and Asp.Net MVC.
